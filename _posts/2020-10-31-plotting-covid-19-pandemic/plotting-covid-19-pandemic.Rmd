In this post, we will visualize spread of worldwide COVID-19 cases through time. I obtained the data from Rami Krispin's website: https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/ using `coronovirus` package. I also decided to do some experimentation using John Coene's fantastic [`echarts4r` package](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/index.html), which allows us to access `echarts` API. 


Load the libraries and get the data in the R session.


```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(echarts4r)
library(coronavirus)

# Get the data
data("coronavirus")
```

## Data Preparation

Print out the first 6 observations.

```{r}
head(coronavirus)
```

We are interested in `date` and `type`. Let's take a look at the distinct values for `type`.

```{r}
coronavirus %>% count(type)
```

There are only 3 values: `confirmed`, `death`, and `recovered`. Next we will create sum of cases for each of the values and store them in separate data sets.

```{r}
dt1 <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(Confirmed = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

dt2 <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "death") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(Death = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")


dt3 <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "recovered") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(Recovered = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")


```


Finally, we will merge the 3 datasets so that we will have the counts of each `type` in separate columns.


```{r}
dt <- dt1 %>% 
  inner_join(dt2, by = "date") %>% 
  inner_join(dt3, by = "date")
```


## Plot

Finally, time to make the plot! Note how we can build this plot in separate elements.

```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6}
dt %>% 
  e_charts(x = date) %>% 
  e_line(serie = Confirmed) %>% 
  e_line(serie = Death) %>% 
  e_line(serie = Recovered) %>% 
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") %>% 
  e_datazoom(type = "slider") %>% 
  e_title("Worldwide COVID-19 cases") %>% 
  e_theme("bee-insipired") 
```

This plot is interactive so you can hover over the plot to get the exact readings. You can also toggle time series on or off by clicking on the legends on top.
