    "contents": "\nIn this post, we will visualize spread of worldwide COVID-19 cases through time. I obtained the data from Rami Krispin’s website: https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/ using coronovirus package. I also decided to do some experimentation using John Coene’s fantastic echarts4r package, which allows us to access echarts API.\nLoad the libraries and get the data in the R session.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(echarts4r)\nlibrary(coronavirus)\n\n# Get the data\ndata(\"coronavirus\")\n\n\n\nData Preparation\nPrint out the first 6 observations.\n\n\nhead(coronavirus)\n\n\n        date province     country      lat     long      type cases\n1 2020-01-22          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n2 2020-01-23          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n3 2020-01-24          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n4 2020-01-25          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n5 2020-01-26          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n6 2020-01-27          Afghanistan 33.93911 67.70995 confirmed     0\n\nWe are interested in date and type. Let’s take a look at the distinct values for type.\n\n\ncoronavirus %>% count(type)\n\n\n       type     n\n1 confirmed 75576\n2     death 75576\n3 recovered 71910\n\nThere are only 3 values: confirmed, death, and recovered. Next we will create sum of cases for each of the values and store them in separate data sets.\n\n\ndt1 <- coronavirus %>% \n  filter(type == \"confirmed\") %>% \n  group_by(date) %>% \n  summarize(Confirmed = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ndt2 <- coronavirus %>% \n  filter(type == \"death\") %>% \n  group_by(date) %>% \n  summarize(Death = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\ndt3 <- coronavirus %>% \n  filter(type == \"recovered\") %>% \n  group_by(date) %>% \n  summarize(Recovered = sum(cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n\nFinally, we will merge the 3 datasets so that we will have the counts of each type in separate columns.\n\n\ndt <- dt1 %>% \n  inner_join(dt2, by = \"date\") %>% \n  inner_join(dt3, by = \"date\")\n\n\n\nPlot\nFinally, time to make the plot! Note how we can build this plot in separate elements.\n\n\ndt %>% \n  e_charts(x = date) %>% \n  e_line(serie = Confirmed) %>% \n  e_line(serie = Death) %>% \n  e_line(serie = Recovered) %>% \n  e_tooltip(trigger = \"axis\") %>% \n  e_datazoom(type = \"slider\") %>% \n  e_title(\"Worldwide COVID-19 cases\") %>% \n  e_theme(\"bee-insipired\") \n\n\npreserve556431f691d872af\n\n\nThis plot is interactive so you can hover over the plot to get the exact readings. You can also toggle time series on or off by clicking on the legends on top.\n\n\n\n",
